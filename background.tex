\chapter{Formalisation of Software}

Synthesis is a process that demands mathematical formalisation in order to
provide a strong guarantee of the correctness of the resultant software. As
such we require a mathematical language to describe the system we wish to
produce, the environment in which it operates, and the properties we want the
system to adhere to. This chapter will outline that language and the ways we
can reason about what we describe in it.

\section{Reactive Systems}

Devices drivers are an example of a reactive system. A reactive system is a
system that is in a continuous process of responding to input from its
environment. A driver accepts requests from the operating system and state
information from the device, and it responds by sending commands to the device
and reporting to the operating system.

B\"uchi automata \cite{Buchi62} are a formalisation of reactive systems.
B\"uchi automata are $\omega$-automata, which means they describe finite
systems that accept an infinite stream of input. This is a useful formalism for
synthesis because we want to create finite systems that responds to input
continuously or infinitely.

Like all $\omega$-automata, the language of a B\"uchi automaton is
$\omega$-regular. A regular language over the alphabet $\Sigma$ is

\begin{itemize}
    \item The empty language $\empty$, \emph{or}
    \item A singleton language $\{a\}$ for $a \in \Sigma$, \emph{or}
    \item For two regular languages $A$ and $B$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $A \cup B$ the union of those languages, \emph{or}
        \item $A \centerdot B$ the concatenation of those languages, \emph{or}
        \item $A*$ the Kleene operation on that language.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

An $\omega$-regular language is a regular language with infinitely long words.
