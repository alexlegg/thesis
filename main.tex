\begin{abstract}

Device drivers are notorious for their contribution to the failure of software
systems. A driver forms the interface between two complicated systems: an
operating system and a hardware device. As a result, driver development is
complicated and highly prone to human error. Driver reliability has been the
focus of much research over the past two decades. One result of this research
is device driver synthesis.

Device driver synthesis aims to remove human error from the development process
by removing humans. A synthesis tool can take a formal specification of
requirements and produce a system. Thus, a driver can be synthesised by
providing the tool with a specification of the OS and the hardware that it must
interface with. The resulting driver is guaranteed to be correct with respect
to the specifications.

The drawback of this approach is that synthesis is a computationally intensive
task belonging to 2-EXPTIME. In practice synthesis tools are capable of
producing drivers though there remain cases where synthesis is impossible. In
this thesis I will present an algorithm that provides results on many of these
previously unattainable cases.
